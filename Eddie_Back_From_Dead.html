Edward told Michael Anthony Sobolowski, Alexander Arthur van Halen, Samuel Roy Hagar, and of course his one and only son, Wolfgang William Van Halen that he is back and they were partying in his studio. Van Halen turned his amplifier as loud as it could go so everybady outside his studio could hear it and one person got so mad the he called the cops on Eddie's playing on the guitar but they didn't know it was Eddie playing the guitar. When the cops enterd the studio they were amazed too see Samual Roy Hagar, Alexander Arthur van Halen, Michael Anthony Sobolowski, Wolfgang William Van Halen, and Eddie in the studio all jamming. After all, the cops did <u>not</u> arrest them. Instead the cops and everybody else had a "Welcome Back From The Dead!" party at the 5150 studio. Eddie described the party as "The most funnest thing I have <b>ever</b> done." That was the most amazing thing that everyone has seen in such a long time. Then the next day they already had a concert to play. the cops described the concert as the biggest concert they have ever had. Over <b>9 million</b> people came to the concert. After the concert the doctors wanted to see Van Halen to see how he came back from the dead.</p>

<h1>The Doctors Discover That Eddie Van Halen Is Immortal! He Is The First Man To Be Immortal.</h1>
<p>It was at the hospital that Eddie died at, which is St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, that they discovered that he is immortal. They also discoverd what made Eddie come back from the dead. It was because a mad scientist was walking next to his grave with a bottle full of some sort of liquid that is a liquid that you pour on people's graves to make them come back from their grave. The scientist was walking near Eddie's grave and he tripped on a rock and spilled the liquid on Van Halen's grave. The scientist then got arrested by the cops because the people nearby heard strange noises in the graveyard so they called the cops and they arrested the sientist because he was also a wanted criminal because he robbed a bank too. Though when the cops saw that Eddie's grave was empty they did not see Eddie because he must have ran off when he had a chance to and to make things even worse it was in the middle of the night and the mad scientist wanted to put the liquid on his firend's grave so his friend came back to life but he tripped and spilled it on Eddie's.</p>
